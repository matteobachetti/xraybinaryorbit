# xraybinaryorb

xraybinaryorb is a user friendly Python package designed to facilitate the analysis of orbital modulations in X-ray binaries. Orbital modulation in these systems are allways present, potentially providing valuable information about XRB systems, but due to the lack of resolution are generally overseen. This modulations can be complex, with numerous parameters influencing the observed X-ray flux. 

With the advent of new, high-resolution telescopes like Athena, the importance of accurately analyzing these modulations has increased significantly. xraybinaryorb provides a suite of functions that simplify this process, making it more accessible to researchers. Whether you're dealing with eclipses, Doppler shifts, or absorption variations, xraybinaryorb offers the tools you need to effectively interpret and understand the intricate behaviors of X-ray binaries.
